I wrote this short prose in Classical Chinese to express my best wishes to the Chinese graduate students among us who cannot have a family reunion due to their curriculum and research in a foreign land. I hope everybody enjoy their work despite not being able to visit their families, and in the end the hard work would pay off!

歲祝犁大淵獻孟春，獺祭雁來，蟄蟲始振。九州之民咸歸鄉里，以躬事親，其樂也融融。維斯學諸君，負笈夷地，雖闕地萬尺而神州弗及。奈何？然格物致知，切磋琢磨，亦別有其趣。夫志厲青雲者不拘小節，義存高遠者不畏䠑踽。於此新歲，吾其願子窮理究業，畢其端緒，以饗方家，方不負其心。勉之！
